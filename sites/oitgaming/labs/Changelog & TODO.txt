Changelog and TODO



December 20, 2015	-	

Refactored essential code into functions and buried the function file underneath the root web directory.  Files still post to login.php, adduser.php, etc., but those files just format the post requests and call the interaction functions.

Fixed login tokens not working on chrome based browsers.  Turns out Chrome accepts a different method of setting the path for cookies.
Just tested, it does still work on Safari.  Also, works on Android Chrome now.  Yay!

Added Steam group members to the the homepage at oitgaming.com.
Script is AJAX'd every time and is very costly (must request xml for
group, then every user in the group and parse that info), but is
located at the bottom of the page so is hardly noticeable.  

//TODO 
Run the group update script every 30 or so minutes and have it write to a text file.  AJAX that text file on page load.

Accounts were added.  There's no real use for them, but they exist.  Database is
mySQL and most things are handled with PHP.  Everything is parameterized.
Passwords are hashed and stored.  Login tokens are separate, similar complexity
hashes.  Login tokens are renewed every time a user logs in and natural expiry
happens after 7 days.
